[Digiwerkplaats](https://https://digiwerkplaatsmkb.nl/) is a organization that helps SME's (small and medium enterprises) with the digital transformation of their companies. In this block we will asssist their goals by performing research that will give important insights to these entrepeneurs. There are several topics that are of interest to SME's, and there are four main research questions that we will focus on:

1. What is the attitude of consumers towards the use of chatbots?

   A lot of companies nowadays use chatbots. However, not all costumers like  chatbots. In this topic, you are urged to find out which parameters cause customers to like or dislike chatting with a chatbot. Variables to look into could be the waiting time for a human employee, the field of business of the company, the capabilities of the chatbots, the personalities of the users, and many more. There is quite some research available on the use of chatbots which can help you formulate a good research question. 

2. What are the expectations of consumers with respect to cybersecurity and privacy?

   With the development of using more data, consumers are also getting more worried about their safety online. In this topic, you will have to find what is important with relation to cybersecurity and privacy and which factors predict that. How should a MSE protect their customers' data and how should they ensure customers that their data is protected? For this topic you do not only have to consider the technical capabilities, but more importantly the attitude and expectations of customers of a small company. 

3. How do consumers find information and assess the reliability of this information?

   Fake news was a hot topic in recent years, and it does not only consider the large media outlets, but also communication between businesses and their customers. For this topic, you will find out how customers prefer to be informed about news of a SME (thinking about websites, social media, news letters, etc.) and how they assess the validity and reliability of the information which is shared. Does this depend of the field of business and/or on specific characteristics of the customer? 

4. What is the common data science & AI knowledge of an employee and how willing are they to learn more about it?

   This is the only topic where the main participant sample is not focused on the customers of an SME but rather on its employees. Big companies usually have a lot of means to train their employees on technological advancements, but SME should be careful with assigning their budgets. Therefore, we need to know what the current knowledge on AI is of the average SME employee and how willing they are to learn about it. It might be interesting to investigate whether this links to the age and experience of an employee, the field of business of the company and the size the of the company. 

There will be multiple groups assigned to the same topic, but we do expect you to choose a more specific research question with your own group. Furthermore, each student is expected to have their own unique sub research question, which can be answered with either quantitative data analysis (e.g. survey data) or qualitative data analysis (e.g. interview or focus group).

### Goal
Your goal for this block is to use quantitative and qualitative methods to explore and understand the impact, possibilities and risks for SME's. This will entail, at the minimum, researching the attitudes, knowledge, acceptance and perceived impact of AI of their consumers within your chosen topic and guiding stakeholders towards the best course of action regarding AI. You will design and run a mixed-method study; meaning you will conduct a survey and do interviews/hold a focus group. You will analyse the results using appropriate quantitative and qualitative methods. You will present your results by a research paper, the results of which should be comprised in a policy paper which in turn should be compressed into a conference poster presentation!

### Stakeholder Analysis
In the context of a policy paper, stakeholder analysis plays a crucial role in understanding the various individuals, groups, and organizations that are influenced by or can influence the policy under consideration. The stakeholder analysis involves identifying, assessing, and prioritizing these stakeholders to gain insights into their interests, needs, perspectives, and potential impacts on the policy. Therefore, for this project, you are required to conduct a stakeholder analysis which needs to be included in your policy paper. 

## Knowledge Modules
The ADS&AI program is structured into 8-week blocks. On Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday you work individually on the development of fundamental skills, which are needed to successfully complete the Creative brief. In DataLab, scheduled on Mondays and Wednesdays, you apply your knowledge to the Creative Brief by completing a list of tasks, which you can find in the [DataLab Tasks](https://adsai.buas.nl/Year2/BlockA/DataLabTasks.html).

Furthermore, there are several knowledge modules related to this block: 
- [Statistics](https://adsai.buas.nl/Study%20Content/Introduction%20to%20Statistics/)
- [Scrum](https://adsai.buas.nl/Study%20Content/Agile%20Project%20Management/Scrum/)
- [Research Ethics](https://buas.libguides.com/rdm/)
- [Digital Transformation (stakeholder analysis)](https://github.com/BredaUniversityADSAI/ADS-AI/blob/a917ce8b71fecae2e1f2cfeeb5deb988ade60611/docs/Study%20Content/Digital%20Transformation/Stakeholder%20analysis%20.pdf)
- [Research Methodology](https://adsai.buas.nl/Study%20Content/Research%20Methodology/Overview.html)
- [Academic Writing](https://adsai.buas.nl/Study%20Content/Research%20Methodology/AcademicWriting.html)


### Templates
Here are the templates for the final deliverables:

The templates contain explanatory texts on how to use LaTeX and what to put in each section. Make sure to remove these texts and fill in your own texts. The templates provide you with a framework on how to set up and format your paper. 
- [Research proposal template](docs/Year2/BlockA/assets/research_proposal_template_Y2A.zip): group deliverable
- [Policy paper template](https://www.overleaf.com/articles/agi-risk-and-friendly-ai-policy-solutions/hrxfvnfpyxnz) The policy paper should also included the stakeholder analysis in the appendix and feature [an executive summary instead of an abstract](https://asana.com/resources/executive-summary-examples): group deliverable
- [Research paper template](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/rho-class-academic-article-template/bpgjxjjqhtfy): individual deliverable

### Group & Individual Components
Please note that the entire project is done in groups apart from the research paper, data analysis script and statistics exam. Those are to be completed individually, and therefore handed in as individual deliverables. This ensures that you can pool in resources for study design, data collection, data management, the policy paper and the final conference presentation; while allowing for individual preferences in data analyses and project dissemination.
