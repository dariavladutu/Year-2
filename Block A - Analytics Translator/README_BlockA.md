## Project Overview  
This mixed-methods research project investigates cybersecurity and privacy practices in Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs), conducted in collaboration with **Digiwerkplaats MKB**. The study explores how SMEs' cybersecurity practices impact consumer confidence and business reputation, with a specific focus on identifying practical, cost-effective solutions including AI/ML technologies and educational initiatives to mitigate cyber threats.

## Research Questions  

### Main Research Question  
*How do SMEs' cybersecurity practices, particularly the implementation or lack of robust security measures, impact consumer confidence and the business reputation of enterprises?*

### Individual Sub-Question (Daria Vlăduțu)  
*What machine learning (ML) solutions could be implemented to reduce business cybersecurity threats?*

### Team Sub-Questions
1. What measures do consumers and SMEs consider effective for protecting customer data while ensuring transparency?
2. How do consumers' past experiences with data breaches influence their expectations of cybersecurity practices in SMEs?
3. How do robust cybersecurity practices impact consumer confidence and the economic benefits of SME investments?
4. What is the current level of awareness among SMEs regarding data privacy?

## Methodology  

### Mixed-Methods Approach  
- **Quantitative Component**
  - Online survey with 86 respondents (European focus)
  - Analysis of cybersecurity awareness and trust factors
  - Statistical analysis using Python (pandas, matplotlib, seaborn)
  
- **Qualitative Component**  
  - 10 semi-structured interviews with consumers (ages 20-30)
  - Thematic analysis of data privacy perceptions
  - Focus on understanding cybersecurity knowledge gaps

### Ethical Considerations
- GDPR-compliant data handling
- Netherlands Code of Conduct for Research Integrity (2018)
- Informed consent and anonymization procedures
- BUas Ethics Review approval


### Personal Contribution
- Conducted interviews with participants
- Performed EDA on all data
- Used gain insights to contribute to the final policy paper & proposal
- Individual Research Paper

## Key Findings  

### Quantitative Results
- **87.21%** of respondents consider data protection measures important
- **77.91%** value transparency about privacy and security practices
- **50%** of respondents have stopped doing business due to privacy concerns
- **70%** of respondents have higher education, indicating awareness correlation
- Younger demographics (25-34) show highest cybersecurity awareness

### Qualitative Insights
- Consumers prefer businesses with transparent data handling practices
- Trust in SMEs is lower than larger enterprises due to perceived resource limitations
- Clear communication about security measures significantly impacts consumer confidence
- Willingness to pay premium for strong data protection

### Solution Recommendations
1. **Educational Initiatives**: Targeted awareness programs using NIST's IPDRR framework
2. **AI/ML Integration**: Intrusion Detection Systems enhanced with machine learning
3. **Transparency Measures**: Clear privacy policies and two-factor authentication
4. **Regulatory Compliance**: ISO/IEC 27001 standards adoption

## Policy Recommendations  

### For SMEs
- Implement layered cybersecurity approach (IDS/IPS, encryption, employee training)
- Adopt cost-effective cloud-based security solutions
- Regular security audits and vulnerability assessments
- Transparent communication of data handling practices

### For Policymakers
- Develop scalable cybersecurity standards tailored to SME resources
- Provide funding opportunities for digital transformation
- Sector-specific certifications (e.g., PCI DSS for retail)
- Extended compliance windows for complex requirements

## Impact & Relevance  

This research addresses critical challenges in SME cybersecurity:
- **Economic Impact**: Cybercrime costs reached €5.5 trillion globally in 2021
- **SME Vulnerability**: 61% of SMEs reported cyber incidents in recent years
- **Trust Factor**: 80% of consumers consider cybersecurity key to business trust
- **Growth Potential**: Effective cybersecurity can increase SME revenue by 5% annually
